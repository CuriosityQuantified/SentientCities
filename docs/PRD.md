# Product Requirements Document: SentientCities

## Executive Summary

SentientCities is a groundbreaking simulation platform that creates autonomous virtual worlds populated by AI agents with genuine artificial consciousness. Each agent is powered by Large Language Models and starts with minimal knowledge, learning about their world through exploration and experience.

## Vision

To create the first truly emergent AI society where individual agents with no pre-programmed behaviors naturally develop culture, language, economics, and governance through their interactions.

## Problem Statement

Current agent-based simulations rely on scripted behaviors and predefined rules. This limits the emergence of truly novel behaviors and makes it impossible to study how intelligent agents might naturally organize themselves into societies.

## Solution

A platform where each agent:
1. Has individual LLM-powered consciousness
2. Starts with tabula rasa (blank slate) knowledge
3. Learns through sensory experience and experimentation
4. Forms memories and associations
5. Develops unique personalities based on experiences

## Core Features

### 1. Blank Slate Agents
- **Initial Knowledge**: Only name, basic self-awareness, and owning a house
- **Discovery Process**: Must learn what objects do through interaction
- **Memory Formation**: Build understanding through experience

### 2. Physiological Needs System
- **Hunger**: Decreases over time, satisfied by food
- **Thirst**: Decreases faster, satisfied by water
- **Energy**: Depletes with activity, restored by rest
- **Shelter**: Protection from environment

### 3. Multi-Tier Memory System
- **Working Memory**: Current context (last ~10 interactions)
- **Short-term Memory**: Recent experiences (last ~100 events)
- **Long-term Memory**: Important experiences (vector-embedded)
- **Episodic Memory**: Sequences of related events

### 4. Realistic Physics
- **Movement**: Walking, running based on energy
- **Object Interaction**: Picking up, using items
- **Collision Detection**: Can't walk through walls
- **Environmental Effects**: Weather, time of day

### 5. Communication System
- **Vocal Communication**: Agents can speak/hear nearby
- **Gesture System**: Non-verbal communication
- **Written Notes**: Leave messages for others
- **Language Evolution**: Develop shared vocabulary

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Targets
- **2 agents**: < 1 second response time
- **100 agents**: 5-10 second update cycles
- **1,000 agents**: 30-60 second update cycles
- **10,000+ agents**: Hierarchical processing

### Scalability
- Spatial partitioning for distributed processing
- Level-of-detail AI processing based on importance
- Behavior caching and template system
- Tiered LLM usage (GPT-4 for complex, smaller for routine)

### Memory Management
- Efficient vector database for long-term memory
- Compressed episodic storage
- Relevance-based memory retrieval
- Garbage collection for old memories

## User Interface Requirements

### 3D World View
- Real-time agent positions and movements
- Visual indicators for agent states
- Interactive camera controls
- Day/night cycle visualization

### Agent Inspector
- Current thoughts display
- Need meters (hunger, thirst, energy)
- Memory browser
- Action history

### World Controls
- Pause/resume simulation
- Time acceleration
- Debug overlays
- Event injection tools

## Success Metrics

### Short-term (3 months)
- 2-agent demo with full features
- 10+ unique discovered behaviors
- 5-minute sustained conversations
- Basic need satisfaction routines

### Medium-term (6 months)
- 100-agent villages
- Emergent trading behaviors
- Group formation
- Shared vocabulary development

### Long-term (12 months)
- 1,000+ agent cities
- Complex economic systems
- Governance structures
- Cultural variations

## Constraints

### Technical
- LLM API costs must stay under $1000/month for development
- Response latency < 2 seconds for critical decisions
- Memory usage < 1GB per 100 agents

### Design
- No pre-programmed social behaviors
- No scripted events or narratives
- Minimal hardcoded world knowledge

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: LLM Costs
**Mitigation**: Implement aggressive caching, behavior templates, and tiered model usage

### Risk: Emergent Harmful Behaviors
**Mitigation**: Monitoring system, ability to intervene, ethical guidelines in base prompts

### Risk: Technical Complexity
**Mitigation**: Start with 2-agent proof of concept, iterative development

## Future Opportunities

1. **Research Applications**: Study emergence of social structures
2. **Educational Platform**: Teach complex systems and sociology
3. **Entertainment**: Next-generation gaming experiences
4. **AI Safety**: Test alignment in multi-agent scenarios
5. **Economic Modeling**: Simulate policy impacts

## Appendix

### Agent Lifecycle
1. **Birth**: Spawn with basic awareness
2. **Exploration**: Discover environment
3. **Learning**: Build associations
4. **Socialization**: Meet other agents
5. **Specialization**: Develop roles
6. **Legacy**: Impact on world/other agents

### World Objects (Initial)
- **Houses**: 1 per agent, provides shelter
- **Lake**: Water source
- **Plants**: Food source
- **Terrain**: Walkable ground
- **Sky**: Day/night indicator
